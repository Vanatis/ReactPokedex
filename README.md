# ReactPokedex (WIP)

A recreation of the pokédex in React.
The focus for this project is learning new technologies, in this case [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Note 04-01-18 : The pokemon.js class is a mess right now. Refactoring is scheduled to happen next week.

## How to install app
This application has been developed as a progressive webapp.
Go to the [Pokédex Website](https://vanatis.github.io/ReactPokedex) and add it to your homescreen.

## API
All Pokémon information is received by using the [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/).
It's a great source for all pokémon related information!

## Sprites
The animated Pokémon sprites are provided by [pokestadium](http://pokestadium.com).
